tree notes

The project stemmed from the idea of parallax. However, the capability to scroll and to introduce new layers was removed in order to have a certain flow to page. 

The image is based on one from a tutorial on flat design, which consist of a number of layers and code. Most of the animation is based on CSS and is triggered through jQuery and timing. 

Moreover, instead of using some plugin for the typewriter effect at the end, a unique javascript was created that makes the appearance of the characters done by a typewriter. There's a piece of code that makes the timing a little random to give it a more organic feel. In addition, the sound of a type writer clacking was added, and at the end, a nice return ding combined with the appearance of the period and sun completes the animation. 

One additional note, the ukulele music was added to enhance the animation effect and to slow down the viewer, as the animation is more about slow-pace and taking in an image that comes together.
